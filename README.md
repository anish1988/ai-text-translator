Make your FastAPI backend clean, extensible, testable, and developer-friendly.

It follows:

Separation of concerns (routes ≠ logic ≠ utils)

Modular structure for teamwork and scalability

Reusable services for business logic

Clear API structure for fast iteration


📁 routes/ — 🧭 All API Endpoints Live Here

📁 services/ — 🧠 Business Logic, Reuseable Code

🔹 models.py — 📦 Pydantic Schemas

🔹 db.py — 🗃 DB Setup

🧠 Big Picture — Why This Structure Works
Concept	Benefit
Modularity	Easy to maintain, update only the module you touch
Testability	Services can be unit tested separately from API
Reusability	LLM calls, PDF generation used in multiple routes
Scalability	Want a new feature? Just add a new route/service
Team Friendly	Backend devs can work independently on translate, upload, etc.
